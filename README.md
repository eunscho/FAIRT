Code and results used in "Interchangeability between Factor Analysis, Logistic IRT, and Normal Ogive IRT"  
R files the code used in the Monte Carlo simulations for Studies 1 through 4.  
The files in the Intermediate_out folder are pre-run files that were compressed into a zip file to speed up the running time of the simulation.
